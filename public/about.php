			<h2><span>Hello!</span></h2>
			<p>Welcome to <i>Asclaria</i>, <a href="/about/lysianthus">Lysianthus</a>’s umbrella network. All of her personal websites, cliques, fanlistings, fansites, shrines, tributes, and miscellaneous projects are under this umbrella.</p>
			<h2><span>Umbrella? What?</span></h2>
			<p>Lysianthus decided to call Asclaria an &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; network, because it does exactly what an umbrella does. It is a thing that &ldquo;includes or contains many different elements or parts&rdquo;. In this context, the elements referred to are Lysianthus’s various online projects.</p>
			<h2><span>What’s in a name?</span></h2>
			<p>The network name &ldquo;<i>asclaria</i>&rdquo; came from nothing; it is a random combination of Lysianthus’s favorite letters, sounds, and syllables from the English alphabet.</p>
			<p>Asclaria didn’t start as asclaria, however. It had undergone many name revamps. This umbrella network was once called <i>Lyffae</i>, <i>Lyqei</i>, <i>Ephevatic</i>, <i>Lascuvia</i>, <i>Clyre</i>, <i>Clyris</i>, and <i>Clyrant</i>. It was the unending search for the original name that both looks and sounds good. <i>Asclaria</i> was chosen for its first launch.</p>
			<h2><span>Domains</span></h2>
			<p>Lysianthus totally runs three domains under this umbrella. They are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>affeli.us</li>
				<li>asclaria.org</li>
				<li>clydoll.me</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each domain is a sub-umbrella.</p>
			<h2><span>Content Breakdown</span></h2>
			<p>Ideally, Asclaria is...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>25% personal &mdash; websites related to Lysianthus</li>
				<li>25% fangirling &mdash; fanlistings, fansites, shrines, and tributes</li>
				<li>25% interactive &mdash; cliques and communities</li>
				<li>25% nonsense &mdash; miscellaneous</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Browse the network to be enlightened.</p>
			<p>Lastly, Asclaria is generously hosted by <a target="_blank" href="http://three-words.net">Three-Words</a>.</p>
